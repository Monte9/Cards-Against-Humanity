Removed column 'user_id' from card model.
Added column 'pick_count' to card model because black card have another attribute called 
how many to pick.
However, as currently we are storing both white and black card in the same table, 'pick_count'
attribute will remain null for white cards. Perhaps we need to split black and white cards into 
seperate tables.



Add column to Game
